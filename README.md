# Sperm Simulator - NJIT Data Fusion Lab

This repository contains the software and MATLAB codes for Sperm Simulator. The methods of simulation are explained in [1].

To install the stand-alone software for the simulator, please download and run SpermSimulator_V6_00-installer.exe. The software has been tested for Windows 10.

The software was built using the MATLAB Compiler (MATLAB version R2021b) and requires MATLAB Runtime to run. The installer should prompt the user to download the MATLAB Runtime. One is able to also simply download and install MATLAB Runtime using the following link:
https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

The software does not require MATLAB license. 

One is able look at the access the raw MATLAB code in __Sperm_Simulator_v6_00_MATLAB_codes__ folder.

The main file to run the simulator is Sperm_Simulator_v6_00.m.

Once the simulator opens, one should see the graphical user interface (GUI) similar to figure 1.

The appearance of the GUI may differ depending on the operating system and screen resolution.

Sample outputs of the simulator are available in [2].

For detailed user manual, please refer to .pdf in this repository.
